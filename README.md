# About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. One programming puzzle a day is released from 1st to 25th December, divided in two parts (the second of which is unlocked after solving the first). Advent of Code is created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl), and is 100% free. If you like Advent Of Code and want to support its creator, you can donate to him [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019/support). If you want to hang out with other fellow coders, discuss about puzzles and solutions, or just have a look around, you can join the official subreddit: [r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/), or the unofficial IRC channel: #adventofcode on irc.libera.chat, where you can also find me at the right time of the year.
